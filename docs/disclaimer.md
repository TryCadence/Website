# Disclaimer

## Important Notice

Cadence is a tool designed to **assist** in detecting AI generated content, but it is **not perfect** and should not be treated as an infallible authority. AI detection is an inherently challenging problem, and no tool including Cadence can guarantee 100% accuracy.

## Limitations

### False Positives
Cadence may occasionally flag content as AI-generated when it was actually written by a human. This can happen because:

- Some human writing styles naturally exhibit patterns similar to AI-generated text
- Technical documentation often uses formulaic language that triggers detection
- Boilerplate code and common programming patterns may be flagged
- Non-native English speakers may have writing patterns that trigger false positives

### False Negatives
Cadence may also miss AI-generated content. This can occur because:

- AI models are constantly evolving and improving
- Some AI-generated content is heavily edited by humans
- New AI writing styles may not match existing detection patterns
- Sophisticated prompt engineering can produce more "human-like" output

### Confidence Scores Are Estimates
The confidence scores provided by Cadence are **probabilistic estimates**, not certainties. A high confidence score suggests a higher likelihood of AI-generated content, but it does not constitute proof.

## Recommended Use

### What Cadence Is Good For

- **Initial screening** of large codebases or content libraries
- **Flagging suspicious content** for human review
- **Trend analysis** across repositories over time
- **Awareness** of potential AI-assisted contributions
- **Educational purposes** to understand AI writing patterns

### What Cadence Is NOT

- A definitive proof that content is AI-generated
- A replacement for human judgment and review
- A tool for making accusations without further investigation
- A legally binding verification system

## Ethical Considerations

Please use Cadence responsibly:

1. **Don't make accusations** based solely on Cadence results
2. **Always follow up** with human review and investigation
3. **Consider context** — AI assistance isn't inherently wrong in many cases
4. **Respect privacy** and follow applicable laws when analyzing content
5. **Communicate openly** about how and why you're using detection tools

## Ongoing Development

I am **actively working** to improve Cadence. This includes:

- **Refining detection strategies** based on real-world feedback
- **Adding new pattern recognition** as AI models evolve
- **Improving accuracy** through community contributions and testing
- **Fixing bugs** and addressing edge cases as they're discovered
- **Updating documentation** to reflect best practices

## How You Can Help

Cadence is open source and community contributions are welcome:

- **Report issues** on [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeMeAPixel/Cadence/issues)
- **Submit improvements** via pull requests
- **Share feedback** on detection accuracy in your use cases
- **Star the repository** to show support
