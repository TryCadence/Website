# Installation

Get Cadence installed and ready to use on your system.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24 or later** - [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl)
- **Git** - Required for repository analysis (pre-installed on most systems)

Verify your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Build from Source (Recommended)

Building from source gives you the latest version with automatic version info injection.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TryCadence/Cadence.git
cd Cadence
```

#### Step 2: Build the Binary

**Using Make (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
make build
# Binary created at: ./bin/cadence
```

**Using PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1
# Binary created at: .\cadence.exe
```

**Using Go directly (all platforms):**

```bash
go build -o cadence ./cmd/cadence
```

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
./cadence version
```

You should see output like:
```
Cadence version v2.1.0
Git Commit: abc123def456
Build Time: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

### Method 2: Go Install

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
go install github.com/TryCadence/Cadence/cmd/cadence@latest
```

Then verify:

```bash
cadence version
```

### Method 3: Download Pre-built Binary

Check [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TryCadence/Cadence/releases) for pre-built binaries for your platform.

## Add to PATH (Optional)

Make `cadence` available from anywhere.

### macOS/Linux

```bash
# Copy to system path
sudo cp ./cadence /usr/local/bin/

# Or create a symlink
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/cadence /usr/local/bin/

# Verify
cadence --help
```

### Windows (PowerShell as Admin)

```powershell
# Add to PATH
$env:PATH += ";$(Get-Location)"

# Make permanent
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "PATH", 
    $env:PATH, 
    "User"
)

# Verify
cadence --help
```

## Build Details

The Makefile and build scripts automatically inject version information from Git tags:

```bash
make build
# Automatically captures:
# - Version from latest git tag (or "0.1.0" if no tags)
# - Short commit hash
# - Build timestamp in UTC
```

Available Make targets:

```bash
make build   # Build binary with version injection
make install # Install to $GOPATH/bin
make test    # Run all tests
make fmt     # Format code
make tidy    # Tidy dependencies
make lint    # Run linter
make vet     # Run go vet
make clean   # Remove build artifacts
make help    # Show all targets
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Go version too old"

If you get an error about Go version, upgrade to 1.24+:

```bash
go version
# If less than 1.24, download from https://golang.org/dl
```

### "command not found: cadence"

The binary is not in your PATH. Either:

1. **Use full path:**
   ```bash
   /path/to/cadence --help
   ./cadence --help
   ```

2. **Add to PATH** - Follow the "Add to PATH" section above

### Build fails with "module not found"

Ensure you're in the Cadence directory and have internet connection:

```bash
cd Cadence
go mod download
go build -o cadence ./cmd/cadence
```

### Permission denied (macOS/Linux)

Make the binary executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./cadence
./cadence --help
```
